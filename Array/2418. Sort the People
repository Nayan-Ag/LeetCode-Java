Ques: You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

Code: 
class Solution {
    public String[] sortPeople(String[] names, int[] heights) {
        int temp1 = 0;
        String temp2 = "";
        for(int i=0 ; i<names.length ;i++){
            for(int j=0 ; j<names.length ; j++){
                if(heights[i] > heights[j]){
                    temp1 = heights[i];
                    heights[i] = heights[j];
                    heights[j] = temp1;
                    temp2 = names[i];
                    names[i] = names[j];
                    names[j] = temp2; 
                }
            }
        }
        return names;
    }
}
