Ques: Given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return true if these points are a boomerang.

A boomerang is a set of three points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

Code:
class Solution {
    public boolean isBoomerang(int[][] points) {
        if(points[0] == points[1] || points[1] == points[2]){
            return  false;
        }
        double slop1 = ( points[1][1] - points[0][1] ) * (points[2][0] - points[1][0] ) ;
        double slop2 = ( points[2][1]  - points[1][1] ) * (points[1][0]  - points[0][0] );
        if(slop1==slop2){return false;}
        return true;
    }
}
